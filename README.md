This project will contain a RPI 5 buildroot that creates the ramdisk image. The image will run SystemInitV init and init.rc will connect to ethernet network, download an opkg ipk file and install the necessary .so's for docker and kubernetes. It will start kubernetes using overlay config file specifying containerd runc option NoPivotRoot. Alternatively it will run docker images using DOCKER_RAMDISK=true. It will be bootable using a dnsmasq tftp server on another embedded device, openwrt. The openwrt, if successful, will be a buildroot that contains a network ingress for kubes. The goal is to send a request to the openwrt containing an image, and the response will be the image modified using image processing.
